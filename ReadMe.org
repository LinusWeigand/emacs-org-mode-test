#+TITLE: Using a reverse proxy with Keycloak to authenticate users
#+PROPERTY: header-args:emacs-lisp :tangle .ecams.d/init.el

* Preface

The reverse proxy is currently the cutting-edge technolody to authenticate users for Web-Applications and is used by all Tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft.
This documetation shows why a reverse proxy is even necessary, the architecture and how to actually implement it with Keycloak.

* Naive Solution

The naive solution is to implement the authentication in the Web-Application itself. This is the most common way to do it and is also the easiest way to implement it. 
The Web-Application has to implement the authentication itself and has to store the user data. This is a problem because the Web-Application has to store the user data and has to implement the authentication itself.
